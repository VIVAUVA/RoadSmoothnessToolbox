# RoadSmoothness

The road smoothness analysis of a noisy time-series data is based on the smoothness computation on a graph. 
It is a region-based operation, not a point-based one. A graph is constructed using a couple of points that
lie within a certain scale. Therefore, using the change of scale both global and local deformation information 
can be computed.

The road smoothness analysis takes a feature layer with point feature class as input and gives two separate 
output layers. 

The first output layer exhibits the absolute value smoothness of a road. The smoothness values are coloured 
encoded in the symbology layer based on warning threshold and critical threshold. 

The second output layer shows a set of polygons based on a group of points. This tool automatically save a 
shapefile for the polygon featureclass in the background. The polygons are colored based on another input 
symbology layer. As an example, a red polygon indicates that smoothness value of the entire polygon is above 
a critical threshold. The minimum number of points that are allowed to form a polygon within the scale is 
set as '3' within the script.
